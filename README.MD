# Q Context

Q Context is a powerful Command Line Interface (CLI) tool designed to help developers manage and switch between different sets of files (contexts) in their projects. It's your friendly companion for:

- üîç Focusing on specific parts of a large codebase
- ü§ñ Preparing relevant code snippets for AI assistants or code reviews
- üöÄ Quickly switching between different areas of work in a project

## Installation

As this project is currently only available on GitHub, you can install it by cloning the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/q-context.git
cd q-context
npm install
```

To use the `q` command globally on your system, you can link the package:

```bash
npm link
```

This will create a symlink to the q-context package in your global node_modules directory.

## Quick Start

1. Initialize Q Context:
   ```bash
   q init
   ```
   This will guide you through creating your first context.

2. Create a new context:
   ```bash
   q update mycontext '*.js' '!node_modules/**'
   ```
   This creates a context named "mycontext" that includes all JavaScript files but excludes the `node_modules` directory.

3. Switch to the context:
   ```bash
   q switch mycontext
   ```

4. Use the context (copy files to clipboard):
   ```bash
   q
   ```
   This will copy the content of all files in your current context to your clipboard.

## Core Concepts

### Contexts

A context in Q Context is a named set of file patterns. These patterns determine which files are included when the context is activated. Think of it as a snapshot of your project that you can easily switch between.

### Patterns

Patterns are glob-style strings that match file paths. They can include wildcards and negations. For example:

- `*.js`: Matches all JavaScript files in the current directory
- `**/*.js`: Matches all JavaScript files in the current directory and all subdirectories
- `!node_modules`: Excludes the `node_modules` directory

### Current Context

The currently active context. When you switch contexts or update a context, it becomes the current context.

### Default Context

A context that is automatically used when no specific context is specified.

## Usage

Q Context uses the concept of "contexts" - named sets of file patterns that determine which files are included when the context is activated. Here are some basic usage examples:

### Creating and Updating Contexts

```bash
# Create a new context for frontend development
q update frontend '**/*.js' '**/*.jsx' '**/*.css' '!node_modules/**'

# Update an existing context to include TypeScript files
q update frontend '**/*.ts' '**/*.tsx'

# Create a context for backend development
q update backend 'server/**/*.js' 'database/**/*.js' '!**/*.test.js'

# Create a context for documentation
q update docs '**/*.md' 'docs/**/*'
```

### Switching Between Contexts

```bash
# Switch to the frontend context
q switch frontend

# Switch to the backend context
q switch backend

# Switch to the documentation context
q switch docs
```

### Using Contexts

```bash
# Use the current context (copies files to clipboard)
q

# Use a specific context without switching to it
q frontend
```

### Listing and Managing Contexts

```bash
# List all available contexts
q list

# Set a default context
q set-default frontend

# Delete a context
q delete old-context
```

### Working with Git

```bash
# Create a context from unstaged git changes
q git-changes recent-work

# Create a context from staged git changes
q git-staged ready-to-commit
```

### Adding and Removing Items from Contexts

```bash
# Add a new file pattern to an existing context
q add frontend '**/*.scss'

# Remove a file pattern from a context
q remove backend '**/*.test.js'

# Add another context as an include
q add fullstack frontend
q add fullstack backend

# Exclude a specific directory
q add frontend '!build/**'
```

## Configuration

Q Context uses a configuration file named `.ctx` to store context definitions. This file can be either local (in your project directory) or global (in your home directory).

### Local vs Global Configuration

- Local configuration: `.ctx` file in your project directory or any parent directory
- Global configuration: `~/.qctx/.ctx` file in your home directory

Local configuration takes precedence over global configuration.

### Configuration File Format

The `.ctx` file can be in either YAML or JSON format. Here's an example:

```yaml
contexts:
  frontend:
    patterns:
      - 'src/**/*.js'
      - 'src/**/*.jsx'
      - 'src/**/*.css'
      - '!src/**/*.test.js'
    maxLines: 20000
    warningThreshold: 10000
    description: "Frontend JavaScript and React files"
    exclude:
      - 'src/vendor/**'
  backend:
    patterns:
      - 'server/**/*.js'
      - 'db/**/*.js'
    include:
      - 'shared'
    description: "Backend Node.js files including shared utilities"
  shared:
    patterns:
      - 'shared/**/*.js'
    description: "Shared utility functions"
default: frontend
maxLines: 30000
warningThreshold: 15000
cleanup:
  enabled: true
  maxAge: 7
  maxFiles: 100
```

## Command Reference

### `q init`

Initialize the configuration interactively.

### `q update <name> [patterns...]`

Create or update a context with the given name and file patterns.

Options:
- `--maxLines`: Maximum number of lines to include in the context
- `--warningThreshold`: Number of lines at which to show a warning
- `--description`: A brief description of the context
- `--include`: Other contexts to include (comma-separated)
- `--exclude`: Patterns to exclude (comma-separated)

### `q switch <name>`

Switch to an existing context.

### `q list`

List all available contexts.

### `q add <context> <item>`

Add a filter, context, or file to an existing context.

### `q remove <context> <item>`

Remove a filter, context, or file from an existing context.

### `q git-changes <name>`

Create a context from unstaged Git changes.

### `q git-staged <name>`

Create a context from staged Git changes.

### `q set-default <name>`

Set the default context.

### `q [context]`

Load the specified context (or the current context if not specified) to the clipboard.

### `q delete <name>`

Delete an existing context.

## Advanced Features

### Context Composition

You can include other contexts within a context using the `include` property. This allows you to create modular and reusable contexts.

Example:
```bash
q update backend 'server/**/*.js' --include shared,database
```

### Debug Mode

Run commands with `DEBUG=true` to see detailed debug output:

```bash
DEBUG=true q
```

This will provide more information about file operations, context loading, and other internal processes.

### MaxLines and Content Truncation

When copying context content to the clipboard, Q Context will truncate the content if it exceeds the `maxLines` limit (either set per-context or globally). This helps prevent performance issues with extremely large contexts.

### State Management

Q Context maintains a separate state file to track the current context per directory. This allows you to have different active contexts in different project directories.

### Context File Storage

When you use the `q` command to load a context to the clipboard, Q Context also saves a copy of the flattened context to a file in the `~/.qctx/` directory. This allows you to:

1. Easily share context files with AI assistants or team members.
2. Keep a history of your context usage.
3. Access previously used contexts without regenerating them.

### Automatic Cleanup

Q Context can automatically clean up old context files based on your configuration settings. This helps manage disk usage and keeps your context history tidy.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Ensure you're using the latest version of Q Context.
2. Check your `.ctx` file for any syntax errors.
3. Run commands with debug output: `DEBUG=true q ...`
4. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to read/write in your project directory and home directory.
5. If a context is not found, ensure it's defined in your `.ctx` file.
6. Check the state file (`~/.qctx/.ctx`) if you're having issues with context switching between directories.
7. If you receive errors about file operations, check your disk space and file permissions.
